# Frequently Asked Questions

#### Can I add any image to the intro or outro?

- As long as you can provide the proper attribution for an image you can use it in your project.

#### I have an older, less powerful, computer, will it handle running this workbench?

- If you open the standard QGIS settings dialog and select the Animation Workbench options you can follow the advice with regards to lowering the number of threads allowed during rendering to help you computer cope. Rendering shorter movies or GIFs (i.e. fewer frames) will also help.

#### I get an error when rendering because of my intro / outro images

Currently your filenames should not contain spaces or special characters (e.g.(, ), [, ], {, }, <, >, /, \, :, *, ?, |, ", &, etc.).

#### Can I use a movie as the intro / outro media?

This is planned but not yet implemented. Tim - check.

#### Can I pay you to add some features?

This is a fun / hobby project, currently we want other contributors who also want to have fun with the plugin and contribute in-kind efforts to the project. Both Kartoza and North-Road offer commercial development services but not for this plugin which is a fun space for us to work on.
