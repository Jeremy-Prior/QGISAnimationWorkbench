# Installing the QGIS Animation Workbench plugin

We have not yet published the plugin in the QGIS Plugin Repository, but when we
do you will be able to access it simply by clicking on the "QGIS Animation Workbench"
option in the QGIS Plugin Manager.

> Note if you are on Ubuntu, you may need to install the Qt5 multimedia libraries.

```bash
sudo apt install PyQt5.QtMultimedia
```
