# Installing the QGIS Animation Workbench plugin

We have not yet published the plugin in the QGIS Plugin Repository, but when we
do you will be able to access it simply by clicking on the "QGIS Animation Workbench"
option in the QGIS Plugin Manager.

To access the QGIS Plugin Manager you simply need to select
**`1`**. `Plugins` -> `Manage and Install Plugins...` in the Menu Toolbar.

**`3`**. type "animation" into the search bar. Select QGIS Animation Workbench from the list
of available plugins and then select **`4`** `Install Plugin`
