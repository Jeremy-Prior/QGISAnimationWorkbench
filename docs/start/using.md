# Using the Animation Workbench

In this section we describe the general workflow for using the Animation Workbench.

## Process Overview

1. Create a QGIS project!
2. Identify features that will be animated.
3. Use the QGIS Expressions system with the variables introduced by the Animation Workbench to define behaviours of your symbols during flight and hover modes of your animation.
4. Open the Animation Workbench and configure your animation, choosing between the different modes and options.
5. Render your animation!
